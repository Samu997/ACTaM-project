# Dean25

Have you have ever been in the situation where you would really like to make up a beat or a rhythmic pattern for your song but you didn't have the time or the knowledge on how to do it using your favourite DAW?
Well, now we have the solution for you!
Dean 25 is an simple drum machine that exploits euclidean patterns in order to produce catchy, relaxing, exotic but even moody, dark and emotional beats in a few easy steps.
It is the place that can reunite either the more advanced producers as well as beginners to get inspiration for their new upcoming songs.

## How does this work?
As said before, Dean25 base its principles on the euclidean patterns. 
But, what are they?
To start off, we need to define two important paramters:
* __Steps__ (or __Tatum__), that corresponds to the shortest durational values in music that are still more than incidentally encountered
* __Pulses__ (or __Tactus__), that corresponds to the OnSets of the of the instrument (the foot tapping rate)

So, Euclidean patterns are a class of musical rhythms where the onsets (pulses) are spread out among the steps as evenly as possible.

## How to use?
In order to create a beat from scratch, just follow this simple steps:
1. In the main page, click the big + icon on the top left corner to add an instrument line
2. Click on the "Nd" button and selecting the sample that you want 
3.  Tune the values of Steps, Pulses and Offset as you like
4. Repeat steps from 1 to 3 until you've added all the instruments that you need
5. Just click on the play button on the top bar and enjoy your creation!
